    "In this lab, you will implement a particle filter for performing state estimation. Consider a system whose state is given by $\\bar{x} = [x,y]$, where $x$ is the x-position of our system and $y$ is the y-position. Assume that we have a perfect model of the dynamics of the system:\n",
    "$$x_{t+1} = x_t + 0.1 x_t,$$\n",
    "$$y_{t+1} = y_t - 0.2 y_t.$$\n",
    "Suppose that we have a sensor that provides an (imperfect) estimate of the distance of the state from the origin. After thorough experimentation, we have found that the following is a good model of our sensor:\n",
    "$$p(z_t | \\bar{x}_t) = \\mathcal{N}(\\|\\bar{x}_t\\|, \\sigma_\\text{meas}^2),$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma_\\text{meas}^2$ is equal to 0.2. In other words, the sensor measurement is a Gaussian random variable with mean equal to the distance $\\|\\bar{x}_t\\|$ from the origin and the standard deviation equal to $\\sigma_\\text{meas}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose further that our initial belief about the state is defined by a Gaussian distribution with mean $[0, 0]$ and covariance equal to the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix, i.e. $\\mathcal{N}(\\bar{0}, I)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each point in time, the true state $\\bar{x}_t$ of the system evolves according to the dynamics given above. But, we do not have a perfect estimate of the state. Instead, we must use the sensor measurements $z_t$ we receive to estimate the state. We will use a particle filter to (approximately) maintain and update a belief over the state. Your task is to fill out the portions of the code below marked \"TODO\" to complete the particle filter implementation. First, we will  import libraries and setup the dynamics:  "
